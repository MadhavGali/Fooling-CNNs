# Fooling-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
•	Designed and developed a model in Keras using VGG16 architecture, which detects and identifies people in the video.

•	Modified some images so that the image to the human eye stills looks the same but the model assumes it as a different class. The prediction rate of the model drops from 81% to 15%.

•	Conducted a survey on a group of individuals and compared the results with the model. The results show that the model is easy to manipulate but the humans are not.
